# Adhan
*High precision prayer time library*

Adhan is a well tested and well documented library for calculating Islamic prayer times implemented in different
languages and platforms.

All astronomical calculations are high precision equations directly from the book 
[“Astronomical Algorithms” by Jean Meeus](http://www.willbell.com/math/mc1.htm). This book is recommended 
by the Astronomical Applications Department of the U.S. Naval Observatory and the Earth System Research Laboratory 
of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

## Discussion & Issues

Issues and feature requests that pertain to all the different platforms (such as a new calculation method) should be
discussed in this repository. Discussions of adding a new language/platform implementation can also be posted here. 
Any issues related to bugs in a specific platform should be discussed in that platform's repository. Likewise, 
pull requests for supporting new platform and/or language features can be opened directly in that platform's repository.

## Contributing

Adhan is made publicly available to provide a well tested and well documented library for Islamic prayer times to all 
developers. We accept feature contributions provided that they are properly documented and include the appropriate 
unit tests. We are also looking for contributions in the form of prayer times for different locations. We do ask that 
the source of the comparison values be properly documented. Pull requests for prayer times can be submitted to 
[adhan-testdata](https://github.com/batoulapps/adhan-testdata). Pull requests for features and/or fixes for a specific language 
should be submitted to the appropriate repository.
